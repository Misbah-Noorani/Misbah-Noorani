## Welcome to my website!

### My name is Misbah. I'm an organizer & technologist. 

I believe that _a better world is possible_, and product management is part of my theory of change.

I have spent most of my adult life working in **product and community management** at early-stage software companies in 
San Francisco, where I currently live. 

I have also led workshops & published a scientific paper on **mindfulness, burnout & resilience.** 

I founded a **technology nonprofit** called [techshift.org](Techshift) over the last few years & I am currently matching volunteer software engineers & product managers with mobilizing **COVID-19 mutual aid** efforts over at [aid.digital](Aid.Digital) 

I am currently searching for full-time employment, an apartment that allows pets, and the meaning of life.

_I'm using some of the time offered by shelter-in-place to work on this website, so visit again sometime :)_
