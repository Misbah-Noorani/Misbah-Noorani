## Welcome to my website!

### My name is Misbah. I'm an organizer & technologist. 

I believe that _a better world is possible_, and product management is part of my theory of change.

I've spent most of my professional life _(~ three years)_ working in **product and community management** at early-stage software companies in San Francisco.

I have led workshops & published a paper on **mindfulness, burnout & resilience.** 
I think these things are usually relevant.

I founded a **technology nonprofit** called [Techshift](http://techshift.org) a few years ago & I'm currently matching volunteer software engineers & product managers with mobilizing **COVID-19 mutual aid** efforts over at [aid.digital](http://aid.digital).

**I am currently searching for full-time employment, an apartment that allows pets, and the meaning of life.**

I'm using some of the time offered by shelter-in-place to work on this website, so visit again sometime :)
