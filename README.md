## Welcome to my website!

My name is Misbah. I believe that _a better world is possible_, and product management is part of my theory of change.

I have spent most of my adult life working in **product and community management** at early stage software startups. I have also published scientific papers and led workshops on **mindfulness, burnout & resilience.** 

Additionally, I started a **technology nonprofit** called [techshift.org](Techshift) over the last few years (we're looking for board members!) & I am currently matching volunteer software engineers & product managers with mobilizing **COVID-19 mutual aid** projects over at [aid.digital](Aid.Digital) 

_I'm also using the space offered by this quarantine to work on this website, so visit again sometime :)_
